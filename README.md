# Autonomous Obstacle-Avoidance Car with GPS and RTOS Integration

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced autonomous car capable of detecting obstacles using ultrasonic sensors, avoiding obstacles in real-time, and integrating GPS for navigation. Additionally, a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) will be employed for efficient multitasking and control. The goal is to create a comprehensive autonomous system that can navigate through obstacles while following a designated path using GPS coordinates.

## Objectives

- Integrate a GPS module for accurate navigation and path following.
- Implement an RTOS for efficient task management and control.
- Enhance the obstacle detection and avoidance system using ultrasonic sensors.
- Develop algorithms for seamless GPS navigation combined with obstacle avoidance.
- Display real-time position and status on an LCD screen.
- Utilize servo motors for improved 180Â° ultrasonic scanning.

## Components and Materials

- Ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensors
- Servo motor
- L293D motor driver
- GPS module
- Microcontroller
- LCD display
- Chassis, motors, and caster wheel
