# Autonomous Obstacle-Avoidance Car with GPS and FreeRTOS Integration

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced autonomous car capable of detecting obstacles using ultrasonic sensors, avoiding obstacles in real-time, integrating GPS for navigation, and utilizing the STM32F103C8 microcontroller along with the FreeRTOS operating system. The combination of these technologies will create a sophisticated autonomous system capable of navigating through obstacles while following a designated path using GPS coordinates.

## Objectives

- Integrate a GPS module for accurate navigation and path following.
- Implement FreeRTOS for efficient task management and control.
- Enhance the obstacle detection and avoidance system using ultrasonic sensors.
- Develop algorithms for seamless GPS navigation combined with obstacle avoidance.
- Display real-time position and status on an LCD screen.
- Utilize servo motors for improved 180Â° ultrasonic scanning.
